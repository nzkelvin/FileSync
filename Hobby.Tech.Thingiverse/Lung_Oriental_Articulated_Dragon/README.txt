# Summary

Articulated Oriental Lung Dragon

This is my Tenth dragon project and brother to Sea Serpent as Most of structure is smilar as it. i was unsure i have to add some accessary as cloud shaped part at Forearm Port and Back leg Port but i didn't have any idea for them. same as Tail Tips which supposed to insert some thin layer part between them.

I was unable to finish Test print this project before leave place for works for undefinitely, i hope you can finish this while i couldn't.

Open Source : My last present for ya, Feel free edit remix and fix, sell your make whatever you want. Just make sure share photo of your makes please!

#Thank you All
 hopefuly see you later with another project... hopefully... in another few years...

# Print Settings

Filament_color: Any
Filament_material: PLA / ABS

Notes: 
#Before try build this dragon

This is 2~3+ weeks long project with large consume of material and times

for example, each 5 piece of segement will take 5~7 hour. and Sepentine body alone at least 60 segments, and even more if you decide extend even futher with extenderble segements. and it difficult to scale down with Claws as some said claw parts are already minimum size with almost no room for scale down. 

it will be better to understand build and structure if you had built one of my dragon especially Sea Serpent before try this dragon.

it will even better if you can use 3ds Max to adjust Ball and sokets itselfs. 

#Part Aligns
 Most parts 45' angled orientation is intended on purpose to protect fragile skirt scales and the Ball from heavy stress presure. please do not request to change it
