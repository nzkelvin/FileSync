# Summary

UPDATE: I have improved the flag significantly, it now includes:
* The regular flag
* A longer version of the regular flag
* A 90째 version of the regular flag
* A longer version of the 90째 flag
* The regular flag holder (it now has a hole for the knob to pop into on both sides, this makes it possible to orient the flag however you like)
* A flag holder with a 90째 angle for mounting on a horizontal surface (it has a hole on either side as well)
* the pin
(just mirror the flags in your slicer to match your needs)
with these new parts you are able to point the flag in every 90째 angle you desire.

A flag that you can stick on the side of your computer screen or any object to indicate that you are busy and not want to be disturbed. you can for example make a deal with the work area, and that everyone gets one, so it is great for an open office environment.
the pole-part of the flag has a little knob that with a satisfying snap, pops into a dent on the flag holder to secure it when you flip it up.
(the holders surface is 22mm x 80mm)

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Wanhao
Printer: Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: I printed it in 0.2 and it looks fine, but the curves will probably look better in 0.1. the pin should be printed in 0.1, as it fits much better this way.

Notes: 
i printed in PLA and it holds up fine, but ABS would probably be the better choice.

no plate adhesion is required.

It has to be strong enough to be pulled out of the flipped-up position, so something like 50% infill for the flag and the flag holder. 
the pin should be 100% infill. 

I printed walls, top and bottom in 1.2 to make it strong.

# Post-Printing

just use some double sided tape to mount it, the holder has a big surface so it should hold up (i have not had issues). Be sure to use some tape that can come of off the object you place it on. Would not want adhesive residue on expensive equipment.
it is also a good idea to clean with some rubbing alcohol before placing it.
If the pin does not want to pop in, just use your teeth or some pliers.
